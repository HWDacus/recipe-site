                     <p class="historytext">The first written record of pasta comes from the Talmud (a central text in Rabbinic Judaism) in the 5th century AD and refers to dried pasta that could be cooked through boiling which was conveniently portable. Some historians think that Berbers (indigenous people of North Africa) introduced pasta to Europe during a conquest of Sicily (the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, part of Italy).</p>
                     <p class="historytext">In the West, it may have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century, as the Tabula Rogeriana (early map of the world by Muhammad al-Idrisi, 1154) attested, reporting some traditions about the Sicilian kingdom (early Sicilian state, 1130-1816)</p>

In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants as Spaghetti Italienne (which likely consisted of noodles cooked past al dente (pasta being cooked    firm to the bite), and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or basil.</p>
